      <p style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        I am a passionate career-changer who transitioned from teaching to web development, bringing a unique blend of creativity, problem-solving, and a love for learning to the tech world. My years in education honed my ability to break down complex concepts and communicate effectively, skills that now empower me to craft intuitive, user-friendly web experiences. 
      </p>
      <p style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
       With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and modern frameworks, I thrive on building dynamic and responsive websites that make a meaningful impact. Iâ€™m driven by a commitment to continuous growth, collaboration, and leveraging technology to solve real-world problems.
      </p>
      <p style={{ paddingLeft: '1rem' }}>
        When I'm not developing, I enjoy hiking, skiing, kayaking, biking, swimming, and all things outdoors. I also enjoy spending time with my husband Mike and our four pets, Greta, Eddie, Hank, and Mike the cat.
